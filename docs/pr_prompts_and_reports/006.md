## PR Body

Navigation across repository documentation was difficult and inconsistent. This adds a universal index that provides high-level navigation with deep links, plus standardizes how agents handle documentation updates.

## Changes

### New: `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
- **Start Here** section with 6 essential entry points
- **By Topic** navigation grouped by area (Local Dev, Database, Seed Data, Analytics, Agents, Vision)
- **Full Inventory** of all 19 `.md` files with one-line descriptions
- **Index Maintenance Policy** describing manual refresh cadence
- **Future Enhancements** with TODOs for automation, link checking, website rendering

### Updated: `README.md`
- Added link to documentation index after Quick Start section

### Updated: `agents/playbooks/docs/update_docs_and_links.md`
- 5-step documentation update workflow requiring index consultation first
- Explicit rule: do not regenerate index unless explicitly requested
- TODO note format for PRs adding new docs:
```
TODO: Add new doc to docs/DOCS_INDEX.md during next documentation refresh
- File: docs/path/to/new_doc.md
- Description: Brief one-line description
```

All changes are additive—no existing docs restructured or deleted.

# GitHub Copilot Agent Prompt — Documentation Index + Agent Hints (Additive)

You are working in an existing repository. Your job is to **add** a documentation navigation system without breaking or rewriting existing docs. Treat this as a **documentation tooling feature**.

## Problem Statement
Our repository now contains multiple Markdown documents (README files and other `.md` docs). Navigation is becoming difficult and inconsistent. We want a **single universal index** that:
- provides a **high-level “big picture”** of the repo documentation,
- provides **deep links** to documents and, where possible, **section anchors** within documents,
- is **additive** and does **not** duplicate the full content of each doc,
- helps both humans and AI agents quickly find authoritative documentation.

We also want to update our **agent guidance** so that whenever a user asks to “update documentation,” the agent follows a standard process:
1) locate the documentation index,  
2) review relevant docs,  
3) update docs in-place as needed,  
4) update the index references accordingly,  
5) do **not** auto-update the index on every change unless explicitly requested.

## Outcomes (Deliverables)
Create or update the following artifacts (additive only):
1) A new top-level doc index file, e.g.:
   - `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md` (preferred), or
   - `DOCS_INDEX.md` in repo root if no `docs/` folder exists.
2) A brief section in the root `README.md` (if present) that links to the index (do not restructure the README; add a small “Documentation Index” entry).
3) Update our agent documentation/rules (wherever agent rules live; search for `agents/`, `agent`, `AGENTS.md`, `agents.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/` guidance, etc.) to include:
   - A rule: **When asked to update documentation**, first consult the documentation index and follow the standard workflow.
   - A rule: **Do not automatically regenerate the full index** unless the prompt explicitly asks to refresh/regenerate the index.
   - A rule: If new docs are added, add a “TODO: add to index” note in the PR description or in a designated TODO section (see below).

## Requirements / Constraints
- **Additive only**: Do not delete or significantly rewrite existing docs. Small edits for consistent naming, broken links, or obvious issues are allowed only if necessary.
- Do not copy large portions of documents into the index. Keep index entries short and navigational.
- The index must link to:
  - documents via relative links,
  - section anchors when feasible (Markdown heading anchors).
- The index must cover:
  - all `.md` files, prioritizing README files, `docs/` content, and any “runbook” style files.
- The index should be:
  - **simple up front**: a short “Start Here” section for the most important docs,
  - then **complete**: a comprehensive inventory (grouped by area).
- Include a section called **“Index Maintenance Policy”** describing:
  - This index is refreshed intentionally (manual cadence) rather than continuously.
  - If a new doc is introduced, add it during the next doc refresh unless explicitly requested sooner.
- Include a section called **“Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)”** with TODOs, such as:
  - website rendering,
  - live search,
  - automated index generation hooks,
  - doc linting / link checking.

## Discovery Steps (What you must do first)
1) Search the repo for all Markdown docs:
   - glob: `**/*.md`
   - also include root `README.md` and any nested READMEs.
2) Identify “entry point” docs:
   - root README
   - Docker runbook / local dev setup
   - database schema docs / mermaid ERD docs
   - seed/ingestion docs
   - agent instruction docs
3) Determine if a `docs/` folder exists; if not, create `docs/` (only if it does not cause structural conflict—if uncertain, place index in root).

## Structure of DOCS_INDEX.md (Template)
Use this structure (adapt to actual repo content):
1) Title + short purpose
2) **Start Here** (top 5–10 links)
3) **By Topic / Area**
   - Local Dev & Docker
   - Database (DDL, schema, naming conventions)
   - Seed Data & Ingestion
   - Analytics / Views / Exercises
   - Agents & Automation Rules
   - Roadmap / Vision (if present)
4) **Full Inventory**
   - list every `.md` file with a one-line description and link
   - group by folder path
5) **Index Maintenance Policy**
6) **Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)**

### Anchor Links
Where possible, link directly to sections using anchors, e.g.:
- `docs/docker/README.md#troubleshooting`
- `README.md#quick-start`

If anchors are uncertain:
- Prefer linking to the file only rather than guessing incorrect anchors.
- If you can safely confirm headings exist, include anchor links.

## Agent Hints Update (Additive)
Locate existing agent instruction files (examples):
- `agents/`
- `docs/agents/`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `agents.md`

Add a new section:
### Documentation Update Workflow
When user requests documentation updates:
1) Open the do...
