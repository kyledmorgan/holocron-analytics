## PR Body

Documentation refresh pass to clean up root-level Markdown and ensure docs index reflects current repo state.

## Changes

### Moved Files
- `OPENALEX_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `docs/integrations/openalex-implementation-summary.md`

### Updated `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
- Added **Integrations** section linking OpenAlex guides
- Added missing entries: `docs/_reports/`, `docs/data-quality/`, `src/ingest/` docs, `seed_expansion_framework.md`

### Updated `agents/README.md`
- Added **Documentation Maintenance** section with refresh workflow guidance

### New: `docs/_reports/folder-structure-recommendations.md`
- Root-level file inventory with justifications
- Proposed cleanup for `_effective-compose.yml`, `Ingest.session.sql`
- Explicit: code moves out of scope

## Root Directory State

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Stays (OSS convention) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Stays (intentional policy reference) |
| `OPENALEX_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Moved to `docs/integrations/` |

No code files moved. Documentation-only changes.

Copilot Prompt: Documentation Delta Refresh + Root Markdown Cleanup (No Code Moves)

You are acting as a documentation maintenance agent for this repository.

Objective

Perform a documentation refresh based on the deltas since the last documentation cleanup. Update the repo docs so they accurately reflect the current codebase and workflows, while reducing root-directory clutter caused by Markdown files that do not belong at the root.

First: Locate and follow our existing documentation ruleset

Before making changes, search the repo for our existing “documentation agent ruleset / instructions” file(s) and follow them. Likely locations/patterns include:

.github/ (e.g., copilot-instructions.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, docs/ guidance)

.vscode/

/docs/ (index + conventions)

Any file containing phrases like: “documentation rules”, “agent rules”, “docs structure”, “style guide”, “index”, “information architecture”

If you find multiple instruction sources, prioritize the most explicit and most recently updated.

Scope (In-Scope)

Update documentation based on deltas since last cleanup

Identify the “last doc cleanup” baseline by inspecting git history (commits touching README.md, docs index files, or a known docs folder).

Review changes to code/config since that point and update docs accordingly: README(s), docs index, setup/runbooks, architecture notes, integration notes, pipelines, tooling instructions, etc.

Root-directory Markdown cleanup (this IS in scope)

Keep the root README.md as the primary entry point.

Any non-README Markdown sitting at repo root that is not clearly meant to be there should be moved into an appropriate docs home (e.g., /docs/...) and linked from the primary docs index.

Example: an “OpenAlex implementation” Markdown should not live at root; it should live under a topic folder (e.g., /docs/integrations/openalex/ or /docs/integrations/openalex.md) and be reachable via the docs index.

Create a folder-structure recommendation report (proposal only)

Produce a short report that suggests improvements to the repository’s folder structure and file placement.

This report must include rationale and concrete suggested paths, but must not rename/refactor/move code at this time.

Explain root-level files

Review the root directory contents (e.g., requirements.txt, Dockerfile, YAML files, etc.).

For each root-level non-doc file, either:

Explain why it belongs at root (build/run conventions, tooling expectations, CI usage, common OSS norms), or

Recommend an alternate location in the folder-structure report (proposal only), if it appears to be clutter.

Out of Scope (Do NOT do these now)

Do not reorganize source code directories or move/rename code files “for cleanliness.”

Do not do broad folder refactors across the repo.

Do not change runtime behavior, packaging behavior, or CI/CD behavior.

Do not introduce breaking path changes.

Constraints / Guardrails

Prefer documentation-only changes (Markdown moves are allowed; code moves are not).

When moving Markdown files:

Preserve content and meaning.

Update all internal links that reference the moved files.

Ensure the root README.md links to a clear “Docs Home / Index”.

Ensure there are no orphan docs: everything should be reachable from the docs index.

If you need a docs home and one does not exist, create a minimal /docs/ structure with an index file.

Required Deliverables

Updated documentation

Root README.md updated (as needed) to reflect current state and link to docs home/index.

Docs home/index updated to reflect current topics and moved Markdown.

Any outdated docs corrected to match current reality since the last cleanup.

Moved root Markdown files (except root README)

Move stray root-level Markdown into /docs/... in a sensible taxonomy.

Add/maintain index entries so they are discoverable.

Folder structure recommendation report (proposal only)

Add a report file at a predictable location such as:

/docs/_reports/folder-structure-recommendations.md (preferred)

Include:

What is currently cluttering root and why

A proposed target structure (tree view is helpful)

Specific suggested moves/renames (proposal only)

Rationale for each recommendation

A note explicitly stating that code moves are out of scope for this pass

Root directory “why it’s here” notes

In the report (or a dedicated section of docs), briefly explain why root-level operational files remain at root (or propose changes in the report only).

Process You Should Follow

Determine baseline: find the last commit that looks like a docs cleanup.

Inventory changes since baseline: focus on meaningful deltas that should be reflected in docs.

Inventory root directory files and classify:

Operational/config (likely stay)

Documentation (move to docs home)

Unknown/legacy artifacts (flag for report; do not change unless it’s Markdown and clearly documentation)

Implement doc updates + root Markdown cleanup.

Update links and indexes.

Produce ...
