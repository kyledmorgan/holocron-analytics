# Interrogation: Atomic Claims Extraction
# Version: 1.0.0
# Status: Example (Phase 0 placeholder)

id: atomic_claims_v1
name: Atomic Claims Extraction
version: "1.0.0"
status: example

description: |
  Extract atomic (falsifiable, self-contained) claims from evidence documents.
  Each claim is a single fact with explicit evidence citations.
  This is an example interrogation definition for Phase 0 scaffolding.

# Notes for implementation
notes: |
  This is a placeholder definition for Phase 0 scaffolding.
  Full implementation is planned for Phase 1.
  
  Key principles:
  - Break compound statements into atomic claims
  - Each claim must be independently falsifiable
  - All claims must cite specific evidence IDs
  - Do not infer beyond what evidence explicitly states
