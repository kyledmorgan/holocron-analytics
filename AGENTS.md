# AGENTS

These instructions apply to any automated or human agent working in this repository. Keep changes small, documented, and aligned with the repo structure.

Key rules:
- Stay tool-agnostic and model-agnostic.
- Prefer placeholders and templates over real data or secrets.
- Follow the repo layout and keep documentation links up to date.
