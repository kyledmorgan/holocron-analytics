## Code of Conduct

This is a **learning project** focused on education and skill development. We expect contributors to:

- Be respectful and constructive in feedback
- Welcome newcomers and learners
- Focus on technical improvement over perfection
- Remember that experimentation is encouraged

---

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please open an issue with:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Docker version, Python version, etc.)
- Any relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea? Open an issue with:

- A clear description of the proposed feature
- Why this would be useful (especially for learning)
- Examples or mockups if applicable
- Whether you're willing to implement it yourself

### Good First Contributions

Looking for something to work on? Consider:

- **Add SQL exercises** — Create new exercises in `exercises/sql/`
- **Improve documentation** — Fix typos, clarify instructions, add examples
- **Create seed data** — Expand seed data coverage for entities
- **Write tests** — Add unit tests or integration tests
- **Add prompt templates** — Create new LLM prompt templates
- **Build visualizations** — Prototype data visualizations

Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `documentation`.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** — For running SQL Server locally
- **Python 3.11+** — For running scripts and tools
- **Git** — For version control

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyledmorgan/holocron-analytics.git
   cd holocron-analytics
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD
   ```

3. **Start the stack:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r src/ingest/requirements.txt
   pip install pytest pytest-env
   ```

5. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   make verify-sqlserver
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Docker Local Dev Runbook](docs/runbooks/docker_local_dev.md).

## Contribution Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Keep changes small** — Small, focused PRs are easier to review
2. **Document your work** — Add README files, code comments, or docs updates
3. **Test your changes** — Run tests before submitting
4. **Follow existing patterns** — Match the style and structure of existing code
5. **Ask questions** — Open an issue if you're unsure about an approach

### What to Contribute

**✅ Encouraged:**
- Schema improvements and new tables
- SQL exercises and learning materials
- Python scripts for data processing
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage additions
- Prompt templates for LLM workflows
- Bug fixes and quality improvements

**⚠️ Discuss First:**
- Major architectural changes
- New external dependencies or frameworks
- Breaking changes to existing schemas
- New automation or CI/CD workflows

**❌ Not Accepted:**
- Copyrighted narrative content (scripts, dialogue, full text)
- Media files (images, video, audio)
- Fan fiction or narrative rewrites
- Scraped content committed to the repo
- Secrets or credentials

See [IP and Data Policy](agents/policies/10_ip-and-data.md) for details.

## Style Guidelines

### Python

- **Use type hints** for function signatures
- **Follow PEP 8** — Use a linter like `flake8` or `black`
- **Write docstrings** — Include module, class, and function docstrings
- **Use logging** — Prefer `logging` over `print` statements
- **Handle errors** — Use try/except with clear error messages

**Example:**
```python
def load_character_data(file_path: Path) -> dict:
    """
    Load character data from a JSON file.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the JSON file
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing character data
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If JSON is invalid
    """
    if not file_path.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {file_path}")
    
    with open(file_path) as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

### SQL

- **Use uppercase keywords** — SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN
- **Indent clauses** — Indent JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.
- **Use meaningful aliases** — `c` for character, `p` for planet
- **Comment complex logic** — Add inline comments for clarity
- **Schema prefixes** — Always use schema names (e.g., `dim.Character`)

**Example:**
```sql
-- Find all human characters from Tatooine
SELECT 
    c.character_name,
    c.species_name,
    c.homeworld_name
FROM dim.Character c
WHERE 
    c.species_name = 'Human'
    AND c.homeworld_name = 'Tatooine'
ORDER BY c.character_name;
```

### Documentation (Markdown)

- **Use headers** — Structure with `#`, `##`, `###`
- **Add code blocks** — Use fenced code blocks with language tags
- **Link to related docs** — Use relative links: `[text](../path/to/doc.md)`
- **Keep it concise** — Brevity is valuable
- **Use tables** — For structured information
- **Add examples** — Show, don't just tell

See [Documentation Update Workflow](agents/playbooks/docs/update_docs_and_links.md) for more details.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests (requires SQL Server)
make test-integration

# Verify SQL Server integration end-to-end
make verify-sqlserver
```

### Writing Tests

- **Place tests in `tests/`** — Match source structure (`tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`)
- **Use pytest** — Follow pytest conventions
- **Name tests clearly** — `test_load_character_data_success`, `test_load_invalid_json_raises_error`
- **Use fixtures** — Leverage pytest fixtures for setup/teardown
- **Mark integration tests** — Use `@pytest.mark.integration` for SQL Server tests

**Example:**
```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
from src.ingest.loader import load_character_data

def test_load_character_data_success(tmp_path):
    """Test loading valid character data."""
    # Setup
    test_file = tmp_path / "test_char.json"
    test_file.write_text('{"name": "Luke Skywalker"}')
    
    # Execute
    result = load_character_data(test_file)
    
    # Assert
    assert result["name"] == "Luke Skywalker"

def test_load_character_data_file_not_found():
    """Test that missing file raises FileNotFoundError."""
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        load_character_data(Path("nonexistent.json"))
```
